# Getting started with Fungi 🍄

:::tip Wait... where's the discord bot invite?
As of **June 13, 2024,** Fungi has **NO OFFICIAL DISCORD BOT INVITE** as one of the main reasons for the bot's existence being having the
ability to be self hosted by anyone and anywhere.
:::

> *Requires Python 3.8 or greater for installation.*

Fungi can easily be installed from **PyPi** by running:

```bash
pip install fungi-bot
```

This would install the **latest stable** version of Fungi to your python installation.

## How to use fungi

Using fungi can be done by doing the following within a terminal.

```bash
fungi start
```

This will start the FTS *(First Time Setup)* of the Fungi Framework with only asking vital information such as, **token, name, prefix, and to have debug mode enabled**

By default, Fungi will store the configuration with the current working directory for instance, if you run `fungi start` in `C:/Users/Example/Documents` and the configuration will be stored in `C:/Users/Example/Documents/fungi.json` for later use and reference.

Once your configuration file is created, the bot will automatically start after FTS and will be ready to use. *See the [Configuration](../config/) guide for more information.*
