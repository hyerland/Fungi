Fungi is a solution of sorts to many bots having advanced customization *(name, branding, etc.)* locked behind **premium subscriptions, purchases, or any other form of monetization** which sucks to **you, the user** simply trying to set up a nice discord server.

This is where Fungi comes in. Fungi was designed to be...

- Modular 🧩
- Easy to use 🚀
- Customizable 💻
- and Free, and Open Source 🔨

## Powered by the community

Fungi being **open-source** allows for the community to voice and support Fungi by suggesting, reporting bugs, and contributing to the project for a tailored solution for everyone.
