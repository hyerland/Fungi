## So... What is exactly Fungi? ü§î

Fungi is a solution of sorts to many bots having advanced customization (name, branding, etc.) locked behind **premium subscriptions, purchases, or any other form of monetization** which sucks to **you,** the user simply trying to set up a nice discord server.

This is where Fungi comes in. Fungi was designed to be...

- Modular üß©
- Easy to use üöÄ
- Customizable üíª
- and Free, and Open Source üî®

## Installation üì¶

> Python 3.8 or greater is required

Fungi can easily be installed from PyPi by running:

```bash
pip install fungi-bot
```

This would install the **latest stable** version of Fungi to your python installation.

### Using Fungi

Using fungi can be done by doing the following within a terminal.

```bash
fungi start
```

#### Creating an application

> If you already have an application and token, you can skip this step.

In order to continue, head to [discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers) to create an application.

- After creating an application, go to the "Bot" tab and generate and copy the token.
  - Never post or share your token with anyone. It's a major security risk and could let to your account getting hacked by bad actors.
- Here is where you can customize the profile of the bot which isn't required but makes your bot nice to use.

> Fungi or Fungi Framework doesn't store any information about your application in servers, fungi only works on your local machine with your configuration.

This will start the **FTS (First Time Setup)** of the Fungi Framework with only asking vital information such as, **token, name, prefix, and to have debug mode enabled.**

By default, Fungi will store the configuration with the current working directory for instance, if you run `fungi start` in `C:/Users/Example/Documents` then the configuration will be stored in `C:/Users/Example/Documents/fungi.json` for later use and reference.

Once your configuration file is created, the bot will automatically start after FTS and will be ready to use. *See the [Configuration guide](https://fungibot.netlify.app/config/#configuration-%F0%9F%94%A8) for more information.*
